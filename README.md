# Deep-Learning-4-Language-Dementia


This code shows how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be employed to develop a language assessment tool for dementia. In other words, we provide a CNN text classifier to classify the interview transcripts of patients with dementia from participants without dementia. 


We create a multi-channel CNN as a text calssification. We use different "n-gram sizes" e.g. various groups of words.
